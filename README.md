# Week 3 Homework JavaScript: Password Generator

## Your Task
Task for this assignment is to create a password generator where the user can select a length between 8-128 characters. Outside this range should give an error. User can choose to include/not include uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers or special characters. Special characters info list can be found at https://owasp.org/www-community/password-special-characters from the OWASP Foundation.

## Project Notes
After initial submission of work I noticed that I forgot 3 test cases in the conditional statement for password generator combinations allowed. That should be fixed with final commit. Alerts will pop up if no allowed parameters are included in initial selection prompts. Also an alert will pop up if character range is outside 8-128 character length. These alerts force the user to begin the password generator again with new selections.
